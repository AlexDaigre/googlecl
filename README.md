#Google CL

[![Downloads](https://pypip.in/d/google_cl/badge.png)](https://crate.io/package/google_cl)

GoogleCl is a fork of [googlecl](https://code.google.com/p/googlecl/) that was
written by Mr. Tom H. Miller(Google). I took over the development since it is no
longer actively developed there, this is an effort to keep the project alive and
rolling.

## HOW TO INSTALL

Installation is simple:

```bash $ git clone https://github.com/vinitkumar/googlecl.git $ python setup.py
install ```

## Current Version:

After small fixes, I moved the version to 0.9.14. Hence will be tagging the code
as the same. Also, Semver will be followed throughout. 

I have changed and moved bit of original documentation for sake for more
readability. In case, you want to consult old documentation, check here:
https://github.com/vinitkumar/googlecl/wiki

## Contribution:

The issues from Google Code repo of GoogleCL has been imported to this repo
here: [Open Issues](
https://github.com/vinitkumar/googlecl/issues?labels=Priority-Medium&state=open)

If you wish to help in the development, fork the repo and send a PR fixing one
of the issues. I will be glad to add you as an collaborator.

In case you wish to read more documentation about the project, the same has been
generated and is live here:
