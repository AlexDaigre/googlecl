[![Downloads](https://pypip.in/d/google_cl/badge.png)](https://crate.io/package/google_cl)

GoogleCl on github is a fork of [googlecl](https://code.google.com/p/googlecl/) that was written by Mr. Tom H. Miller 
of Google. Currently the project is mainly in inactive stage in terms of development. I will try to add new features 
and fix some existing bugs in this period.


### HOW TO INSTALL


Short instructions:
From the command line, in the directory as this file, run

```bash
$ sudo python setup.py install
```

or

```bash
$ python setup.py install --home=~
```

(remember to set your PYTHONPATH to include your home directory if you do it this way)

### Contribution:

- Create new issues if you find something that is not working.
- Original styleguide of the project will be followed throughout. It is kind of a big projects so pay sometime to get hang of it.
- Suggestions and contributions are always welcome.
